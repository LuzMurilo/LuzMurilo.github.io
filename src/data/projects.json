In this game the goal is to make connections between the 'Stars' to form the right constellation. The player is able to shoot colored 'Planets' that orbit the Star it collides with, and if another Star has a planet of the same color, a connection is made. I developed this game from scratch in a week. All aspects, except the music, were made by me.",
